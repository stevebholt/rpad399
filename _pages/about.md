Weclome to the course page for Policy Research: The Art of Creating Convincing Evidence! The course will provide a piece-by-piece overview of the research process with an eye toward linking research questions to appropriate research designs. This course page is where you'll find written posts that walk through activities we do together in class, assignment materials, and lecture slides. You'll also find the datasets for replicating our labs and the data needed for any problem sets here. The syllabus to the course can be found [here](/syllabus/).
