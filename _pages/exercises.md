# In-Class Exercises
**Exercise 1:** In this exercise, you will each have 10 minutes to read an excerpt from a study in a policy area of potential research interest. You will then be asked to identify 1) the policy (either directly named or implied) evaluated in the study, 2) the main research question, and 3) the data used to answer the research question.
